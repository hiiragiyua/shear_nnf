====== How to run newton with many options =====

[*] compile

make newton

[*] the setting file ( hre3.dat ) is required for newton program, 
in addition to hre2.dat. 
-- please copy hre3.dat in the working folder (the same place of hre2.dat) the default option is used..., hre3.dat should be finished by the line 

-- The normal DNS/LES run of 'disk3d' also uses hre3.dat.

-- see the test runs, all of the revision of newton code should be checked.

HREEND

[*] options for newton method of SS-HST 

If you did not set option, the default values are used. 
see subroutine set_options() 

=== general options (disk3d and newton) ===
The structure of options
--------------
command
1 
[...]
--------------

(*) set the file dump mode  

idump_mode [default:0 using nimag in hre2.dat]
2     ! for constant time intervals. 
200 5 ! this means 200 box period, dumping snapshots at every 1/5 box-period
      ! [6 10] is used for 6Tp-UPO movie. 


(*) set symmetry as below. 
!symmetry     ! 5: shift-refrection
              ! 6: mirror-symmetry
              ! 7: rotation-refrection for varicose (UPO4)
              ! 8: rotation-refrection for sinuous
! if the initial condition does not have symmetry, shift in x and z, appropliately

iadd_sym
5
0.d0 0.d0  


- [iadd_force] ! testing option for streamwise rollers (2-pair as in Itano2006, 4-vortex tyep)
- [iadd_damping] ! testing option for windowing HST simulation in tall box...

(*) set the time stepping scheme
![1: default explicit time stepping, 0: implicit time stepping ]
explicit 
1

(*) set LES 

iuse_LES [default is 0 to do DNS]
1
0 0 0.17 ! idynamic, 0:smagorinsky ! iadd_visc ! Cs

(*) [LES option] keep the Cs*Delta of the initial condition (iread_footer=1 and above Cs is ignored)
Use this for changing grid size. 

ifix_CsDeltag [default is 0]
1

(*) read additional parameter written in footer (Deltag and Cs, etc), 
the original code does not have this footer.
To read the original data, set iread_footer=0. [Default is iread_footer=1] 

iread_footer
0

(*) skip screen output, the time history is written in .cf or .cfbin....
In the newton iteration, the screenoutput is very redundunt.

iskip_screenout
1

=== suboptions for newton ===
[*] see set_newton_options() in gmres_shear.f90
Do not use the testing options.

(*) This set the newton mode 

isol_mode
3  ! 3,UPO; 4,RPOxz; 5,UPOt; 6,RPOxzt
2  ! search an UPO with the multiple of a box period, m*Lx/Ly.  
0.d0  0.d0  0.d0 ! shiftx0, shifty0, shiftz0 ! set initial shift, this should be consistent with the symmetry.

- [inorm] ! do not use this (testing several norms) 

(*) If you want the temporal data at each iteration of newton method. set 

iskip_save
0

(*) arclength mode... iread_footer=1 is required...
! 1, use arclength; -1, simply change the parameter.

iarclength
./pool/var.0000   ![the neighbour solution is required for the tangent of solution curve]
0.1d0 Ayz         ![arclength parameter and continuation parameter: Axz Ayz Rez, Cles, ... ]
10                ![the number of iteration]

(*) the accuracy of the matrix-vector product [default is 1 (first order), 2 (for central difference)].

iopt_matvec	 
1

(*) set the option for throwing flow field to the unknown vector.
[iuse_ffty = 1, use Fourier in y for 00modes of U,W]
[iuse_us=1 is for velocity norm, instead of Fourier modes of oy]
[iuse_v=1 (default is 1) is for velocity norm instead of (lap.v) ]

iuse_ffty
0

iuse_us
1

- [iuse_mpc] ! not updated from 2014 september (testing for preconditioning)
- [ifilter] ! not updated from 2014 september
- [iremove_singularity] ! testing
- [iuse_scaling] ! testing
- [iuse_compensatory_norm]

(*) the orthogonarization option. In  default, QR decomposition (requires double of memory) is used for the good accuracy of orthogonarization.
